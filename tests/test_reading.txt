 A Look at the Automatic Mechanism in Action
 We marvel at the awesomeness of interceptor missiles
 which can compute in a flash the point of interception of
 another missile and "be there" at the correct instant to
 make contact.
 Yet, are we not witnessing something just as wonderful
 each time we see a center fielder catch a fly ball? In order
 to compute where the ball will fall, or where the "point
 of interception" will be, he must take into account the
 speed of the ball, its curvature of fall, its direction, wind
age, initial velocity and the rate of progressive decrease
 in velocity. He must make these computations so fast that
 he will be able to "take off" at the crack of the bat. Next,
 he must compute just how fast he must run, and in what
 direction in order to arrive at the point of interception at
 the same time the ball does. The center fielder doesn't even
 think about this. His built-in goal-striving mechanism
 computes it for him from data which he feeds it through
 his eyes and ears. The computer in his brain takes this in
formation, compares it with stored data (memories of
 other successes and failures in catching fly balls). All
 necessary computations are made in a flash and orders
 are issued to his leg muscles—and he "just runs."
 Science Can Build the Computer but Not the Operator
 Dr. Wiener has said that at no time in the foreseeable
 future will scientists be able to construct an electronic
 brain anywhere near comparable to the human brain. "I
 think that our gadget-conscious public has shown an un
awareness of the special advantages and special disadvan
tages of electronic machinery, as compared with the
 human brain," he says. "The number of switching devices
24
 PSYCHO-CYBERNETICS
 in the human brain vastly exceeds the number in any
 computing machine yet developed, or even thought of for
 design in the near future."
 But even should such a machine be built, it would lack
 an "operator." A computer does not have a forebrain, nor
 an "I." It cannot pose problems to itself. It has no imag
ination and cannot set goals for itself. It cannot determine
 which goals are worthwhile and which are not. It has no
 emotions. It cannot "feel." It works only on new data fed
 to it by an operator, by feedback data it secures from its
 own "sense organs" and from information previously
 stored.
 Is There an Infinite Storehouse of Ideas, Knowledge, and
 Power?
 Many great thinkers of all ages have believed that man's
 "stored information" is not limited to his own memories
 of past experiences, and learned facts. "There is one mind
 common to all individual men," said Emerson, who com
pared our individual minds to the inlets in an ocean of
 universal mind.
 Edison believed that he got some of his ideas from a
 source outside himself. Once, when complimented for a
 creative idea, he disclaimed credit, saying that "ideas are
 in the air," and if he had not discovered it, someone else
 would have.
 Dr. J. B. Rhine, head of Duke University's Para
psychology Laboratory, has proved experimentally that
 man has access to knowledge, facts, and ideas, other than
 his own individual memory or stored information from
 learning or experience. Telepathy, clairvoyance, precogni
tion have been established by scientific laboratory experi
ments. His findings, that man possesses some "extra sen
sory factor," which he calls "Psi," are no longer doubted
 by scientists who have seriously reviewed his work. As
 Professor R. H. Thouless of Cambridge University says,
 "The reality of the phenomena must be regarded as

 proved as certainly as anything in scientific research can
 be proved."
 "We have found," says Dr. Rhine, "that there is a ca
pacity for acquiring knowledge that transcends the sen
sory functions. This extra sensory capacity can give us
 knowledge certainly of objective and very likely of sub
jective states, knowledge of matter and most probably of
 minds."
 Schubert is said to have told a friend that his own
 creative process consisted in "remembering a melody" that
 neither he nor anyone else had ever thought of before.
 Many creative artists, as well as psychologists who have
 made a study of the creative process, have been impressed
 by the similarity of creative inspiration, sudden revelation,
 intuition, etc., and ordinary human memory.
 Searching for a new idea, or an answer to a problem,
 is in fact, very similar to searching memory for a name
 you have forgotten. You know that the name is "there,"
 or else you would not search. The scanner in your brain
 scans back over stored memories until the desired name is
 "recognized" or "discovered."
 The Answer Exists Now
 In much the same way, when we set out to find a new
 idea, or the answer to a problem, we must assume that
 the answer exists already—somewhere, and set out to find
 it. Dr. Norbert Wiener has said, "Once a scientist attacks
 a problem which he knows to have an answer, his entire
 attitude is changed. He is already some fifty per cent of
 his way toward that answer." (Norbert Wiener, The
 Human Use of Human Beings, Houghton Mifflin, New
 York.)
 When you set out to do creative work—whether in the
 field of selling, managing a business, writing a sonnet, im
proving human relations, or whatever, you begin with a
 goal in mind, an end to be achieved, a "target" answer,
 which, although perhaps somewhat vague, will be "recog

 nized" when achieved. If you really mean business, have
 an intense desire, and begin to think intensely about all
 angles of the problem—your creative mechanism goes to
 work—and the "scanner" we spoke of earlier begins to
 scan back through stored information, or "grope" its way
 to an answer. It selects an idea here, a fact there, a series
 of former experiences, and relates them—or "ties them to
gether" into a meaningful whole which will "fill out" the
 incompleted portion of your situation, complete your
 equation, or "solve" your problem. When this solution is
 served up to your consciousness—often at an unguarded
 moment when you are thinking of something else—or per
haps even as a dream while your consciousness is asleep
 —something "clicks" and you at once "recognize" this as
 the answer you have been searching for.
 In this process, does your creative mechanism also have
 access to stored information in a universal mind? Numer
ous experiences of creative workers would seem to indi
cate that it does. How else, for example, explain the ex
perience of Louis Agassiz, told by his wife:
 "He had been striving to decipher the somewhat obscure
 impression of a fossil fish on the stone slab in which it was
 preserved. Weary and perplexed, he put his work aside at
 last and tried to dismiss it from his mind. Shortly after, he
 waked one night persuaded that while asleep he had seen
 his fish with all the missing features perfectly restored.
 "He went early to the Jardin des Plantes, thinking that
 on looking anew at the impression he would see something
 to put him on the track of his vision. In vain—the blurred
 record was as blank as ever. The next night he saw the
 fish again, but when he waked it disappeared from his
 memory as before. Hoping the same experience might be
 repeated, on the third night he placed a pencil and paper
 beside his bed before going to sleep.
 "Towards morning the fish reappeared in his dream,
 confusedly at first, but at last with such distinctness that
 he no longer had any doubt as to its zoological characters.

 Still half dreaming, in perfect darkness, he traced these
 characters on the sheet of paper at the bedside.
 "In the morning he was surprised to see in his nocturnal
 sketch features which he thought it impossible the fossil
 itself would reveal. He hastened to the Jardin des Plantes
 and, with his drawing as a guide, succeeded in chiseling
 away the surface of the stone under which portions of the
 fish proved to be hidden. When wholly exposed, the fossil
 corresponded with his dream and his drawing, and he suc
ceeded in classifying it with ease.
