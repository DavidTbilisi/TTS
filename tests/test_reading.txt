 GENERAL PRINCIPLES
 The "self-image" is the key to human personality and
 human behavior. Change the self-image and you change
 the personality and the behavior.
 But mote than this. The "self-image" sets the bound
aries of individual accomplishment. It defines what you
 can and cannot do. Expand the self-image and you ex
pand the "area of the possible." The development of an
 adequate, realistic self-image will seem to imbue the in
dividual with new capabilities, new talents and literally
 turn failure into success.
 Self-image psychology has not only been proved on its
 own merits, but it explains many phenomena which have
 long been known but not properly understood in the past.
 For example, there is today irrefutable clinical evidence
 in the fields of individual psychology, psychosomatic
 medicine and industrial psychology that there are "suc
cess-type personalities" and "failure-type personalities,"
 "happiness-prone personalities" and "unhappiness-prone
 personalities," and "health-prone personalities" and "dis
ease-prone personalities." Self-image psychology throws
 new light on these and many other observable facts of
 life. It throws new light on "the power of positive think
ing," and more importantly, explains why it "works" with
 some individuals and not with others. ("Positive thinking"
 does indeed "work" when it is consistent with the individ
ual's self-image. It literally cannot "work" when it is
 inconsistent with the self-image—until the self-image it
self has been changed.)
 In order to understand self-image psychology, and use
 it in your own life, you need to know something of the
 mechanism it employs to accomplish its goal. There is an
 abundance of scientific evidence which shows that the
 human brain and nervous system operate purposefully in
 accordance with the known principles of Cybernetics to
 accomplish goals of the individual. Insofar as function is
 concerned, the brain and nervous system constitute a mar
velous and complex "goal-striving mechanism," a sort of
 built-in automatic guidance system which works for you
 as a "success mechanism," or against you as a "failure
 mechanism," depending on how "YOU," the operator,
 operate it and the goals you set for it.
 It is also rather ironic that Cybernetics, which began as
 a study of machines and mechanical principles, goes far
 to restore the dignity of man as a unique, creative being.
 Psychology, which began with the study of man's psyche,
 or soul, almost ended by depriving man of his soul. The
 behaviorist, who understood neither the "man" nor his
 machine, and thereby confused the one with the other,
 told us that thought is merely the movement of electrons
 and consciousness merely a chemical action. "Will" and
 "purpose" were myths. Cybernetics, which began with the
 study of physical machines, makes no such mistake. The
 science of Cybernetics does not tell us that "man" is a
 machine but that man has and uses a machine. Moreover,
 it tells us how that machine functions and how it can be
 used.
 EXPERIENCING IS THE SECRET
 The self-image is changed, for better or worse, not by
 intellect alone, nor by intellectual knowledge alone, but
 by "experiencing." Wittingly or unwittingly you devel
oped your self-image by your creative experiencing in the
 past. You can change it by the same method.
 It is not the child who is taught about love but the child
 who has experienced love that grows into a healthy,
 happy, well-adjusted adult. Our present state of self-con
fidence and poise is the result of what we have "experi
enced" rather than what we have learned intellectually.
 Self-image psychology also bridges the gap and resolves
 apparent conflicts between the various therapeutic
 methods used today. It furnishes a common denominator
 for direct and indirect counselling, clinical psychology,
 psychoanalysis, and even auto-suggestion. All in one way
 or another use creative experiencing to build a better self
image. Regardless of theories, this is what really happens,
 for example, in the "therapeutic situation" employed by
 the psychoanalytical school: The analyst never criticizes,
 disapproves, or moralizes, is never shocked, as the patient
 pours out his fears, his shames, his guilt-feelings and his
 "bad thoughts." For perhaps the first time in his life the
 patient experiences acceptance as a human being; he
 "feels" that his self has some worth and dignity, and he
 comes to accept himself, and to conceive of his "self" in
 new terms.
 
 SCIENCE DISCOVERS
 "SYNTHETIC" EXPERIENCE
 Another discovery, this time in the field of experimental
 and clinical psychology, enables us to use "experiencing"
 as a direct and controlled method of changing the self
image. Actual, real-life experience can be a hard and ruth
less teacher. Throw a man in water over his head and the
 experience may teach him to swim. The same experience
 may cause another man to drown. The Army "makes a
 man" out of many young boys. But there is no doubting
 that Army experience also makes many psycho-neurotics.
 For centuries it has been recognized that "Nothing suc
ceeds like success." We learn to function successfully by
 experiencing success. Memories of past successes act as
 built-in "stored information" which gives us self-confidence for the present task. But how can a person draw
 upon memories of past successful experiences when he has
 experienced only failure? His plight is somewhat compa
rable to the young man who cannot secure a job because
 he has no experience, and cannot acquire experience be
cause he cannot get a job.
 This dilemma was solved by another important dis
covery which, for all practical purposes, allows us to syn
thesize "experience," to literally create experience, and
 control it, in the laboratory of our minds. Experimental
 and clinical psychologists have proved beyond a shadow
 of a doubt that the human nervous system cannot tell the
 difference between an "actual" experience and an experi
ence imagined vividly and in detail. Although this may
 appear to be a rather extravagant statement, in this book
 we will examine some controlled laboratory experiments
 where this type of "synthetic" experience has been used
 in very practical ways to improve skill in dart throwing
 and shooting basketball goals. We will see it at work in
 the lives of individuals who have used it to improve their
 skill in public speaking, overcome fear of the dentist, de
velop social poise, develop self-confidence, sell more
 goods, become more proficient in chess—and in practi
cally every other conceivable type of situation where "ex
perience" is recognized to bring success. We will take a
 look at an amazing experiment in which two prominent
 doctors arranged things so that neurotics could experience
 "normally," and thereby cured them!
