This is a comprehensive test of the streaming playback feature. When you use the streaming mode, audio starts playing almost immediately while generation continues in the background.

The streaming feature provides several key benefits. First, it dramatically reduces perceived latency from 10-30 seconds down to just 2-3 seconds for time to first audio. Second, it provides immediate feedback so users know the system is working. Third, it allows multitasking where you can start listening while remaining chunks generate.

The implementation uses a queue-based approach with a background playback thread. As each chunk completes generation, it's immediately added to the playback queue. The player monitors this queue and starts playback as soon as the first chunk is available. This architecture ensures minimal overhead while providing maximum responsiveness.

Platform support varies slightly. On Windows, the system plays the first chunk immediately using os.startfile, then provides the complete merged file. On Linux and macOS, systems with mpv or ffplay can achieve truly seamless streaming playback across all chunks.

The feature is completely optional and backward compatible. Simply add the --stream flag to enable it. Without the flag, the system behaves exactly as before, generating all audio before playback begins. This makes it safe to deploy without breaking existing workflows.

Performance testing shows the streaming mode adds less than one percent overhead to total generation time, while reducing perceived wait time by eighty to ninety percent. This makes it a significant user experience improvement with minimal cost.

Try it yourself with any long text, article, or document. You'll immediately notice how much faster and more responsive the system feels. The combination of parallel generation and streaming playback creates a truly modern text-to-speech experience.
